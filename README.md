## Pac-Man
#### What is Pac-Man?
*Eh, Seriously?..*  Google it.
#### What is this project?
This project was created in 2021 when I was studying bachelor's IT programme at MFFUK (Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics). The Programming class' semester project was to create an application in Windows Forms and I chose to re-create the legendary Pac-Man. 

The game itself is pretty rustic, it was my second bigger project (the first being [PyDeflektor](https://github.com/marekblvn/PyDeflektor)), but it is playable. The ghosts don't necessarily move as they should, but they move and attack you. You can collect points and fruits and try to get a high score.

#### How to play
Since the game is made using Windows Forms, you need to be on Windows to play the game. 

If you are running Windows, then just download the [`pac-man.rar`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marekblvn/Pac-Man/main/pac-man/pac-man.rar) file, unzip and then run `pac-man\bin\Release\net5.0-windows\Pac-Man.exe`. 

*Note: The fonts will probably not display properly, because as I mentioned above, it was one of my first projects so there is a lot of unresolved bugs. But I'm still pretty proud of it nonetheless.*
